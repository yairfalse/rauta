# ENVOY CODEBASE EXPLORATION - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Project:** RAUTA (Rust + eBPF L7 Ingress Controller)  
**Context:** Understanding Envoy's HTTP routing & observability for Stage 1 (Rust control plane)

---

## EXPLORATION SCOPE

This exploration examined how Envoy (the gold-standard C++ L7 proxy) implements:
1. **HTTP Routing** - How requests are matched to backends
2. **Configuration Model** - Static vs. dynamic route updates
3. **Observability** - Metrics, latency tracking, logging
4. **Load Balancing** - Consistent hashing algorithms (Ring Hash, Maglev)
5. **Performance Optimization** - <25μs per-request latency

**Key Codebase Locations:**
- `/source/common/router/` - Core routing logic (62KB header, 3KB implementation files)
- `/source/extensions/load_balancing_policies/` - LB algorithms (Maglev, Ring Hash)
- `/api/envoy/config/route/v3/` - Route configuration protos
- `/source/common/stats/` - Metrics & observability

---

## TOP 5 ARCHITECTURAL INSIGHTS

### 1. Hierarchical Routing Model (Two-Level)

Envoy routes in **two stages**:

```
Step 1: Domain → VirtualHost (O(log N))
  - Exact match: www.example.com
  - Suffix wildcard: *.example.com
  - Prefix wildcard: example.*
  - Catch-all: *

Step 2: Path → Route within VirtualHost (O(1) to O(N))
  - Exact path: /api/exact
  - Prefix: /api/ (fastest)
  - Regex: ^/v[0-9]+/.*
  - URI Template: /items/{id}
  - Matched in order (first match wins)
```

**Why it matters:** Separates host-based routing (CDN, multi-tenancy) from path-based routing (API versioning, feature flags). This is the **proven pattern** Envoy uses.

**For RAUTA:** Implement identical two-level hierarchy in Rust.

---

### 2. Immutable Route Trees + Atomic Updates

Routes are **immutable after creation**:
- Routes compiled to a read-only tree at boot
- Route objects are const-shared-ptr (read-only references)
- Updates via RDS (Route Discovery Service) perform **atomic swaps**

```
Old Route Tree    New Route Tree
      ↓                  ↓
[shared_ptr] ────────────────────→ SWAP (atomic)
                 ↑
            New requests use new tree
            Old requests continue on old tree
```

**Why it matters:** Zero-copy, lock-free hot reload. In-flight requests see no disruption.

**For RAUTA:** Use `Arc<RouteConfig>` in Rust. Update = swap pointer, not mutation.

---

### 3. Per-Route Statistics (Critical)

Each named route has its own stats:
- `requests_total` (counter)
- `requests_active` (gauge)
- `request_latency_us` (histogram: p50, p99, p99.9)
- `upstream_latency_us` (histogram)
- Error breakdown (5xx, 4xx, timeout)

```rust
metrics.route_stats[route.name].request_latency_us.record(42); // μs
```

**Why it matters:** You can instantly see which routes are slow, which have errors. This is **debugging gold** for operators.

**For RAUTA:** Build per-route stats from day 1 (not as an afterthought).

---

### 4. Maglev Hash > Ring Hash for Affinity

**Maglev Algorithm** (Google, 2016):
- Fixed table size: 65537 (prime)
- Lookup: O(1) direct array index
- Distribution: More uniform than Ring Hash
- Memory: Compact variant uses BitArray

**Ring Hash** (Ketama):
- Variable ring size: 1K - 8M
- Lookup: O(log N) binary search
- Distribution: Good but not as uniform
- More CPU per lookup

```
Maglev:  table[hash % 65537] → Backend
         O(1), very uniform
         
Ring Hash: binary_search(ring, hash) → Backend
          O(log N), good uniform
```

**Why it matters:** Maglev ensures even load across backends. Ring Hash has "hot shards" (imbalanced hash collisions).

**For RAUTA:** Use Maglev if backend affinity is needed (e.g., session persistence).

---

### 5. Thread-Local Route Caching (No Locks)

Routes cached in thread-local storage, one per worker thread:

```
Main thread:
  1. Receive RDS update
  2. Create new RouteConfig
  3. Broadcast to all workers
  
Each worker thread:
  thread_local: Arc<RouteConfig> route_config_;
  // Atomically swap old → new
  route_config_ = Arc::clone(&new_config);
```

**Why it matters:** Lock-free routing decisions. No contention on hot path.

**For RAUTA:** Use `thread_local!()` in Rust for per-worker route cache.

---

## DESIGN PATTERNS TO ADOPT

| Pattern | Envoy Example | RAUTA Application |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Hierarchical Matching** | VirtualHost → Route | Domain → Path → Backend |
| **Immutable Config Trees** | Route objects const-shared-ptr | Use `Arc<RouteConfig>` |
| **Atomic Hot Reload** | RDS swap | Route versioning + atomic pointer swap |
| **Per-Route Metrics** | RouteStats | Per-route latency histogram |
| **Consistent Hashing** | Maglev (O(1)) | Use Maglev for session affinity |
| **Thread-Local Caching** | Per-worker route copy | `thread_local!(Arc<RouteConfig>)` |
| **Header Mutations** | Parser hierarchy | Group mutations by specificity |
| **Bounded Memory** | Fixed size tables | No unbounded HashMap allocation |

---

## PERFORMANCE BASELINE

**Envoy's per-request latency breakdown:**

```
VirtualHost Selection:   1-5 μs   (trie lookup)
Route Selection:         1-10 μs  (linear in routes, but ~10 routes typical)
Load Balancer:           0.1-5 μs (Maglev 0.1, Ring Hash 1-5)
Pool Lookup:             1-2 μs   (hash of (host, port, TLS))
─────────────────────────────────
Total:                   5-25 μs  (excluding network/TLS)
```

**For RAUTA Stage 1 (userspace Rust):**
- Aim for similar latency: <100 μs per routing decision
- Use benchmarks early (criterion.rs)
- Profile with perf/flamegraph

---

## CRITICAL DECISIONS FOR RAUTA

### 1. Route Matching Strategy

**Envoy's approach:**
- Support multiple match types (prefix, exact, regex, template)
- Factory pattern to create right implementation
- Compiled upfront (regex pre-compiled)

**RAUTA recommendation:**
```rust
pub enum PathMatcher {
    Exact(String),
    Prefix(String),
    Regex(CompiledRegex),  // Pre-compiled at boot
}

impl PathMatcher {
    fn matches(&self, path: &str) -> bool { ... }
}
```

### 2. Configuration Update Mechanism

**Envoy's approach:**
- RDS (gRPC streaming) pushes updates
- Validate on update
- Atomic swap in all workers

**RAUTA Stage 1:**
- Start with static routes from YAML
- Stage 2: Add dynamic updates (K8s watch or gRPC)
- Use route versioning for debugging

### 3. Observability

**Envoy's approach:**
- Per-worker thread stats (no lock contention)
- Per-route stats (critical for debugging)
- Histograms with percentiles (p50, p99, p99.9)

**RAUTA Stage 1:**
```rust
pub struct RouteStats {
    requests_total: Counter,
    requests_active: Gauge,
    latency_us: Histogram,  // CircllHist or similar
}

pub struct RautaMetrics {
    routes: HashMap<String, Arc<RouteStats>>,
}
```

### 4. Load Balancing

**RAUTA Stage 1:**
- Start with simple round-robin
- Stage 2: Add consistent hashing (Maglev)
- Hash on: source IP (default) or user header

---

## ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID

### Don't do L7 routing in XDP ❌

Envoy routes at L7 in **userspace** for good reasons:
- HTTP is variable-length (multi-packet)
- Route decisions need stateful context
- TLS termination required (breaks L7)
- Logging/metrics need user context

**Better approach:**
1. XDP: Detect flows, classify packets
2. Userspace: Make routing decisions
3. XDP: Forward packets (using redirect maps)

### Don't use unbounded memory ❌

Envoy uses **fixed-size tables**:
- Max route entries: configurable
- Connection pools: bounded per host
- Header buffers: pre-allocated

**RAUTA:**
```rust
// BAD:
let mut routes = HashMap::new();  // Unbounded!

// GOOD:
let mut routes = HashMap::with_capacity(10000);  // Bounded
```

### Don't skip per-route stats ❌

Envoy treats per-route metrics as **first-class**:
- Route name → stats lookup (instant debugging)
- Spot slow routes immediately
- Required for SLO tracking
