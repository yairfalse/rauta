# Envoy Codebase Exploration Results

This directory contains a comprehensive analysis of Envoy's HTTP routing, configuration, and observability architecture. These documents were created to inform RAUTA Stage 1 (Rust-based ingress controller) design decisions.

## Documents Included

### 1. ENVOY_EXPLORATION_SUMMARY.md (10KB, 370 lines)
**Start here first.** Executive summary of key findings.

**Contents:**
- Top 5 architectural insights (hierarchical routing, atomic updates, per-route stats, Maglev, thread-local caching)
- Design patterns to adopt vs. anti-patterns to avoid
- Performance baseline (5-25μs per request)
- Implementation roadmap for RAUTA Stage 1
- Critical design decisions

**Key Takeaways:**
- Envoy uses proven two-level routing hierarchy: Domain → Path
- Routes are immutable; updates via atomic pointer swaps (lock-free)
- Per-route metrics are critical for operational debugging
- Use Maglev hashing (O(1)) instead of Ring Hash (O(log N))

4. Load Balancer Algorithms

   - Maglev Hash visual example (65537-entry table)
   - Comparison of O(log N) vs O(1)

5. Header Modification Pipeline
   - Specificity-based ordering
   - Three levels: global, vhost, route
   - Application order (least → most specific)

6. Hot Reload / Route Update Flow
   - RDS API streaming
   - Validation
   - Atomic swap per worker
   - No disruption to in-flight requests

7. Performance Optimizations
   - Hot vs. cold paths
   - Memory management
   - Estimated latency breakdown (5-25μs total)

## Key Findings

### Architectural Patterns

1. **Hierarchical Routing** (VirtualHost → Route)
   - Domain-based multiplexing (fast, 1-5μs)
   - Path-based routing within domain (1-10μs)
   - Order: exact > suffix wildcard > prefix wildcard > catch-all

2. **Immutable Route Trees + Atomic Updates**
   - Routes compiled to read-only tree
   - Updates: old_tree ↔ new_tree (atomic swap)
   - In-flight requests: zero disruption
   - Implementation: `const shared_ptr<const RouteConfig>`

3. **Per-Route Statistics (Must-Have)**
   - requests_total, requests_active (gauge)
   - latency_us histogram (p50, p99, p99.9)
   - Error breakdown (5xx, 4xx, timeout)
   - Critical for operational debugging

4. **Consistent Hashing (Maglev > Ring Hash)**
   - Maglev: O(1) lookup, fixed table size 65537, very uniform distribution
   - Ring Hash: O(log N) lookup, variable ring size, good distribution
   - Use Maglev for session affinity

5. **Thread-Local Route Caching (Lock-Free)**
   - Per-worker thread copy of route config
   - Atomic swap on updates
   - Zero lock contention on hot path

### Performance Targets

| Component | Latency | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| VirtualHost selection | 1-5μs | Trie lookup |
| Route selection | 1-10μs | Linear in routes (~10 typical) |
| Load balancer (Maglev) | 0.1-1μs | Direct array index |
| Load balancer (Ring Hash) | 1-5μs | Binary search |
| Pool lookup | 1-2μs | Hash of (host, port, TLS) |
| **Total** | **5-25μs** | Excluding network/TLS |

### Design Decisions for RAUTA Stage 1

1. **Route Matching**: Support prefix, exact, regex (compile regex upfront)
2. **Config Updates**: Start with static YAML, Stage 2 add K8s watch
3. **Observability**: Per-route counters/gauges/histograms from day 1
4. **Load Balancing**: Round-robin first, Stage 2 add Maglev
5. **Hot Reload**: Implement atomic updates with versioning

## For RAUTA Stage 1 Implementation

1. **Read first**: ENVOY_EXPLORATION_SUMMARY.md (10 min read)
2. **Refer during design**: ENVOY_ANALYSIS.md (detailed reference)
3. **Visual understanding**: ENVOY_ROUTING_DIAGRAM.txt (architecture clarity)

### Recommended Adoption Priority

**Must implement:**
- Hierarchical routing (VirtualHost → Route)
- Per-route metrics (requests, latency, errors)
- Immutable route config + atomic updates
- Multiple path match types (prefix, exact, regex)

**Should implement:**
- Maglev for consistent hashing
- Thread-local route caching
- Header mutations by specificity
- Access logging with filters

**Can defer:**
- Dynamic K8s route discovery (Stage 2)
- Advanced load balancing (weighted, canary)
- Per-filter config per route

## Discussion Points

These documents should inform discussions on:
1. **Configuration format**: Proto vs. YAML vs. both?
2. **Update mechanism**: K8s watch vs. gRPC xDS vs. file polling?
3. **Load balancer algorithm**: Round-robin first or Maglev?
4. **Observability granularity**: Per-route or per-virtual-host?
5. **Memory bounds**: Max routes, max backends, max header size?
