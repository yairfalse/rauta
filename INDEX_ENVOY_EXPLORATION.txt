TOP 5 INSIGHTS
==============

1. Two-level hierarchical routing (Domain → Path)
   - Envoy: VirtualHost (domain matching) → Route (path matching)
   - Performance: 1-5μs domain, 1-10μs path matching
   - RAUTA: Adopt same pattern

2. Immutable route trees + atomic updates (lock-free hot reload)
   - Envoy: const shared_ptr<const RouteConfig>
   - Updates: atomic swap of pointer (no locks)
   - RAUTA: Use Arc<RouteConfig> in Rust

3. Per-route statistics (must-have for operations)
   - Envoy: each route has counters, gauges, histograms
   - Critical for: debugging, SLO tracking, alerting
   - RAUTA: implement from day 1, not as afterthought

4. Maglev hash (O(1)) > Ring Hash (O(log N))
   - Maglev: 65537-entry fixed table, direct lookup, uniform distribution
   - Ring Hash: variable size, binary search, good but less uniform
   - RAUTA: use Maglev for session affinity (if needed)

5. Thread-local route caching (zero lock contention)
   - Envoy: per-worker thread copy of route config
   - Updates: atomic broadcast to all workers
   - RAUTA: use thread_local!(Arc<RouteConfig>) in Rust

DESIGN DECISIONS FOR RAUTA STAGE 1
===================================

Route Matching:
  ✓ Support prefix, exact, regex matching
  ✓ Pre-compile regex at boot (fail fast)
  ✓ Match routes in order (first match wins)

Configuration:
  ✓ Stage 1: Static YAML routes
  ✓ Stage 2: K8s Ingress watch
  ✓ Stage 3: gRPC xDS dynamic routes

Observability:
  ✓ Per-route requests_total (counter)
  ✓ Per-route requests_active (gauge)
  ✓ Per-route latency_us (histogram: p50, p99, p99.9)
  ✓ Error breakdown (5xx, 4xx, timeout)
  ✓ Prometheus export

Load Balancing:
  ✓ Stage 1: Round-robin
  ✓ Stage 2: Maglev consistent hashing
  ✓ Hash on: source IP or custom header

Hot Reload:
  ✓ Route versioning
  ✓ Atomic config swap (Arc pointer)
  ✓ Zero disruption to in-flight requests

PERFORMANCE TARGETS
===================

Envoy Current:           RAUTA Target:
- VirtualHost:  1-5μs     <10μs
- Route:        1-10μs    <20μs
- Load balance: 0.1-5μs   <10μs
- Pool lookup:  1-2μs     <5μs
                ────       ────
- TOTAL:        5-25μs    <50μs

(excluding network/TLS)

IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP
======================

Stage 1 (Immediate - Weeks 1-6):
  ├─ Hierarchical routing (domain → path)
  ├─ Multiple path matchers (exact, prefix, regex)
  ├─ Per-route statistics
  ├─ Immutable config + atomic updates
  └─ Round-robin load balancing

Stage 2 (Following - Weeks 7-12):
  ├─ Consistent hashing (Maglev)
  ├─ Thread-local route caching
  ├─ K8s Ingress watch
  └─ Header mutations by specificity

Stage 3+ (Advanced):
  ├─ Weighted load balancing
  ├─ Canary deployments
  ├─ gRPC xDS dynamic routes
  ├─ Per-filter config per route
  └─ Traffic shadowing / mirroring

ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID
======================

❌ Don't route at L7 in XDP
   → Better: parse/classify in XDP, decide in userspace

❌ Don't use unbounded memory
   → Use: bounded HashMaps with fixed capacity

❌ Don't skip per-route stats
   → Must: implement route-level metrics from start

❌ Don't ignore hot reload edge cases
   → Test: in-flight requests during config update

❌ Don't mix sync/async stats
   → Choose: async (Envoy pattern) for high concurrency

DISCUSSION POINTS
=================

Before starting implementation:

1. Configuration Format?
   - Proto (like Envoy) vs. YAML vs. both?
   - Static files vs. dynamic K8s watch?

2. Update Mechanism?
   - File polling vs. K8s watch vs. gRPC xDS?

3. Load Balancer Priority?
   - Round-robin first vs. Maglev from start?

4. Observability Granularity?
   - Per-route stats vs. per-virtual-host?
   - What metrics matter most?

5. Memory Constraints?
   - Max routes, max backends, max header size?
   - Pre-allocation strategy?
